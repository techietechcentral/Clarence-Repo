    "1. In main.py, import function_1 from module_1 and call it. Test it works by running python main.py in the terminal. You should see the message \"This is function 1 in module 1\"\n",
    "2. Import function_2 from module_1 and call it. Test it works by running python main.py in the terminal. You should see the message \"This is function 2 in module 1\"\n",
    "3. Now, import function_1 from module_2 and call it. Test it works by running python main.py in the terminal. You should see the message \"This is function 1 in module 2\"\n",
    "- Notice that you imported function_1 twice. Which one got called when you ran python main.py? Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Import modules from packages\n",
    "1. In main.py, import function_package() from package_1.module_1 and call it. Test it works by running python main.py in the terminal. You should see the message \"I am in function_package() in package_1/module_1.py\"\n",
    "- Notice that you can import modules that are inside a package, just like you can import modules that are in the same folder as your main file. This makes it easier to organise your code into different files and folders.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Import variables from modules\n",
    "\n",
    "- Download the following zip  file and extract it to your working directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Open module_2.py. Check that there is a variable called x in the file. This variable is not inside a function, so it is a global variable and you can access it from any other file.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In main.py, import x from module_2 and print it. Test that it works by running python main.py in the terminal. You should see the message 'Hello, I am in module 2'\n",
    "2. Now, in main.py, create another variable called x and assign it the value \"Hello, I am in main.py\". Then, print x. Test that it works by running python main.py in the terminal. You should see the message \"Hello, I am in main.py\"\n",
    "- Notice that the value of x has changed now. This is because you overwrote the value of x when running main.py.\n",

    "\n",

    "1. Open main_notebook.ipynb and from module_1, import function_1 and call it. Test it works by running the cell. You should see the message \"This is function 1 in module 1\"\n",
    "2. Now, open module_1.py and change the message to \"This is function 1 in module 1. I have been changed!\". Then, run the cell in main_notebook.ipynb again. You should see the message \"This is function 1 in module 1\"\n",
    "- The message is the same as before, even though you changed it in module_1.py. This is because you imported function_1 before you made the change. If you want to see the changes, you will need to restart the kernel and run the cell again.\n",
    "\n",

    "3. Packages are usually imported with an alias. Import pandas as pd and print the version of pandas that you have installed. You can find the version of pandas by running pd.version in the terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Giving Aliases to modules\n",
    "- There are many 3rd party packages that share the same name for their modules. For example, datetime has a class called time, and there is another package called time that has a module called time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a new file called alias.py\n",
    "In alias.py, import time and call time.time(). You should see the current timestamp printed, something like \"1661958068.7087212\"\n",
    "Now, from datetime, import time and call time.time(). You should see an error like: \"AttributeError: type object 'datetime.time' has no attribute 'time'\"\n",
    "Instead of calling time.time(), call time(). You should see a time printed, in this case \"00:00:00\"\n",
    "This is because both time calls are trying to call different functions with the same name. The first time you were calling time.time(), which is a function that returns the current timestamp. The second time you were calling the time() class, which returns an object with the time you specified. If you want to tell them apart, you can give them aliases.\n"
