    "- 2. **Float (float)**: represents decimal numbers, e.g. 0.0, 3.14, -2.5, etc.\n",
    "- 3. **Boolean (bool)**: represents either True or False.\n",
    "- 4. **String (str)**: represents a sequence of characters enclosed in quotes, e.g. 'hello', \"world\", '123', etc.\n",
    "- 5. **List (list)**: represents an ordered collection of items enclosed in square brackets, e.g. [1, 2, 3], ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'], etc.\n",
    "- 6. **Tuple (tuple)**: represents an ordered, immutable collection of items enclosed in parentheses, e.g. (1, 2, 3), ('apple', 'banana', 'cherry'), etc.\n",
    "- 7. **Set (set)**: represents an unordered collection of unique items enclosed in curly braces, \n",
    "e.g. {1, 2, 3}, {'apple', 'banana', 'cherry'}, etc.\n",
    "- 8. **Dictionary (dict)**: represents a collection of key-value pairs enclosed in curly braces, \n",
    "e.g. {'name': 'John', 'age': 30}, {'fruit': 'apple', 'color': 'red'}, etc.\n",
    "Each of these data types has its own unique set of properties and methods. \n",

They are templates for objects and various instances of such templates can be created.
